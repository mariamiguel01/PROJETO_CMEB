To explore all the features and purpose of the app, it is necessary to place the device in the 
upper back, connect to it via BLE and calibrate your correct position.
This app provides real-time posture feedback with snap alerts to correct the posture, saving an 
historic of alerts. It also presents a statistical posture analysis (daily and monthly), so the user 
can control his/her progress over time using the mobile app. 
Some news related to posture and health are present in the app to inform the user about the 
importance of health and adopting a correct posture. A video with exercises to improve posture 
and reduce back pain is also available and should be used frequently, especially when alerts are 
produced.
Back Saver also includes a gamification with points and 6 levels, to encourage the user to explore 
all the application's features to the fullest and motivate him/her to use the application. Points 
can be earned by reading news, watching the video with exercises and by having a high daily 
percentage of correct posture.
To help the user understand the app and explore all these functionalities, an explanation of the 
rules of the app is also available.
